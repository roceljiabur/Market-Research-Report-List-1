<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Defibrillator</li><li>Biphasic Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The manual defibrillator market is primarily divided into two types: single-phase and biphasic defibrillators. Single-phase defibrillators deliver a shock in one direction, which can be effective but may cause more myocardial damage. In contrast, biphasic defibrillators provide a shock in two phases, allowing for more efficient defibrillation with reduced risk of injury, improving patient outcomes. The biphasic design is increasingly preferred in clinical settings due to its effectiveness and safety profile, driving market growth.</p></p>
